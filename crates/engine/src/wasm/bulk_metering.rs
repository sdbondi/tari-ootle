//! Length-aware metering for the bulk memory operators and `table.init`.
//!
//! The static cost function in [`super::metering`] prices one operator at one constant, which is
//! the wrong shape for an operator whose work is a runtime operand: `memory.copy` moves between 0
//! and 4 GiB of bytes for the same instruction. This middleware adds the length-proportional half
//! of the charge, emitted inline against the same remaining-points global the
//! [`tari_wasmer_middlewares::Metering`] middleware installs, so an oversized copy traps on the
//! meter before the copy runs rather than after.
//!
//! It must be pushed *after* `Metering`. Middleware stages run in push order, each consuming the
//! previous stage's output, so pushing second means the metering global indexes are already
//! recorded and the operators emitted here bypass static costing.
